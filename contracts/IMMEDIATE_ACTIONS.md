# Immediate Actions - CrossMind Project

## 🎯 What to Do Right Now

### 1. **Test Frontend Integration** (5 minutes)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Open http://localhost:3000
- Test wallet connection
- Verify dashboard displays correctly

### 2. **Document Fuji Limitation** (2 minutes)

- Add note to README about Fuji testnet not being supported in CCIP
- This is a known Chainlink limitation, not your code issue

### 3. **Prepare Hackathon Submission** (10 minutes)

- Create demo video showing:
  - Wallet connection
  - Token deposit
  - Strategy registration
  - CCIP message sending (even if Fuji fails)
- Document the technical achievement

### 4. **Optional: Test Mumbai Testnet** (15 minutes)

If you want to show full cross-chain functionality:

```bash
# Add Mumbai environment variables
export MUMBAI_RPC_URL="https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY"
export MUMBAI_PRIVATE_KEY="your_mumbai_private_key"

# Deploy executor on Mumbai
forge script script/DeployCrossChainExecutor.s.sol --rpc-url $MUMBAI_RPC_URL --broadcast
```
